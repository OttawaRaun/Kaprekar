# Kaprekar
Kaprekar's constant is a theorem devised by a renowned Indian Science Person which essentially stipulates if you had a 4 digit number where at least 2 digits were different, and sorted those 4 digits into ascending and descending orders respectively and then subtracted those two numbers from one another--subtracting from whichever is greater-- and run the resulting number through this whole process again, you eventually are going to get 6174 as a result.
